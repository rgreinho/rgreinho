ScrAPD is a collection of tools to automatically collect information about traffic fatalities in the city of Austin, TX and render it on a modern dashboard.

The goal of the project is to help grassroots organizations, local communities and individuals advocate in favor of the Vision Zero program.

We believe that representing this information on graphs and maps helps people better understand the importance of this plague and feel more involved to address the issue.
