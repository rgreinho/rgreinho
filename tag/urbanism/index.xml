      <description>&lt;p&gt;AURA is an all-volunteer grassroots urbanist organization focused on building an Austin for everyone by improving land use and transportation through policy analysis, public involvement, and political engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are dedicated to a vision of an Austin where everybody is welcome and everybodyâ€™s interests matter: young and old, rich and poor, renter and homeowner, healthy and sick, citizen and immigrant, lifelong resident and new arrival. The greatest asset our city has is its people, and our city is at its best when it facilitates connections between all.&lt;/p&gt;
